# Angular BlackJack Perfect Strategy

This project is purely for learning. Goal is to have an Angular App where you can play blackjack and get feedback on if you're correctly playing perfect strategy. Still looks ugly so may or may not fix that. Hope to add extra features like Surrender, Splitting, Betting/Bet Spreads etc. down the road or I may just move on to something else, idk.
